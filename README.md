# Codeigniter4 RestfulAPI
This RestfulAPI was developed by me to be used for a football themed project. Now It's completely free to use, edit and manipulate by **anyone** with **any purpose**!
## Features
- Authentication with **JWT**
- Login and register endpoints
- Ready and free to edit & use!
## How to Use
Clone the repo and edit your apache server's `httpd.conf` and `httpd-vhosts.conf` files
### httpd.conf
    ...
    DocumentRoot "C:\{PROJECT_ROOT}\public"
    <Directory "C:\{PROJECT_ROOT}\public/">
    ...
### httpd-vhosts.conf
    ...
    DocumentRoot "C:\{PROJECT_ROOT}\public"
    <Directory "C:\{PROJECT_ROOT}\public/">
    ...
Then restart your apache server to apply new configs. Navigate to http://localhost:80/. If the response is `{"success":true}` you are ready to go! (Please don't forget to create database with the `db.sql` file)
